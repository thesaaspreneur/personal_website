There's something about building things from scratch that never gets old. The blank canvas. The first line of code. The moment it works.

## The joy of shipping

Most side projects die in the idea phase. The ones that survive are the ones you actually ship — even if they're rough, even if they're embarrassing.

## Lessons learned

1. **Ship early.** Perfection is the enemy of done.
2. **Build for yourself first.** If you find it useful, someone else probably will too.
3. **Keep it simple.** The best tools are the ones that do one thing well.

The world doesn't need another todo app. But it might need *your* version of something you care about.
