This is the first post on my new website. I've been meaning to start writing for a while, and here we are.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about the things I care about — startups, cinema, poetry, philosophy, history, and whatever else catches my attention. No fixed schedule, no niche. Just honest thinking.

## Why now?

I got tired of waiting to become a better writer before starting. The only way to get better is to ship. So here we go.

More soon.
