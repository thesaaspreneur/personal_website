This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Updated whenever things change.

## Working on

Platform PM at Enterpret — building out the integration ecosystem and taxonomy system. Helping teams at Canva, Notion, and Perplexity make sense of customer feedback at scale.

On the side, building this website as a place to think in public. Trying to dissolve the tension between "personal site" and "newsletter" into one clean system.

## Investing

Venture Fellow at Day Zero. Spending time with founders at the pre-seed and seed stage — the moment where the idea is still fragile and the conviction has to come from somewhere real.

Currently interested in: developer tools, AI infrastructure, and anything that makes knowledge work less painful.

## Reading

- *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov
- *Zero to One* by Peter Thiel (re-read)
- Various papers on taxonomy systems and knowledge graphs

## Listening to

Been on a Radiohead deep dive — *Kid A* and *In Rainbows* on repeat. Also discovering Japanese jazz fusion from the 70s. Ryo Fukui's *Scenery* is extraordinary.

A lot of Brian Eno and Nils Frahm for focused work.

## Thinking about

How taste develops through constraint, not abundance. Why the best software feels like it was made by one person even when it wasn't. The relationship between philosophy and product design. Whether "building in public" is genuine or performative — and how to make it the former.
