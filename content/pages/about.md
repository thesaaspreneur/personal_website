Hey — I'm Rahul.

I'm interested in a lot of things: cinema, poetry, startups, philosophy, history, open source, and the occasional rabbit hole. This site is where I write about all of it.

## Why this site exists

I believe in learning in public. Writing helps me think, and sharing helps me connect with people who care about the same things.

## What I do

I build things — mostly software, sometimes ideas. I'm drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of technology and the humanities.

## Get in touch

The best way to reach me is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com). I read every message.
